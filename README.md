# Ragged Write
## Materials for the typographically inclined

Hello, good evening, and welcome.

This is the public repository for Ragged Write, a link blog of sorts dedicating to the curation of notable typographic oddities, references, articles, and news.

Designed, developed, curated, and maintained by [Daniel Eden](https://daneden.me), Ragged Write is a selfish endeavor to fulfill a want for a curated collection of typographic resources. In a rather unselfish twist, the materials and resources curated are, in fact, shared with the public, together with some subjective commentary.

The repo exists in the public realm so that you, fine reader, may contribute suggestions for improvements and so on.
