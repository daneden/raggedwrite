Mark Simonson:

> Wes Anderson seems to have a thing, bordering on obsession, for Futura. The credits are set in Futura Bold—nothing strange about that. But it doesn’t stop there. The Tenenbaums seem to exist in a world dominated by Futura (mainly Futura Bold)

The obsession doesn’t stop at The Royal Tenebaums, either. [Futura](http://www.linotype.com/472/futura-family.html) makes an appearance in all of Wes Anderson’s films (post-“Bottle Rocket”), and his attention to detail isn’t lost on the other typographic elements comprising his filmography.
