From the overwhelming array of dashes and their kin, to the elusive intended paragraph, the stories of the origins of punctuation are few and far between. But Keith Houston’s “[Shady Characters](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393064425/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393064425&linkCode=as2&tag=raggwrit-20)” collates all these mysteries and hosts them in a beautifully designed, entertaining, and informative book.

Houston goes to great lengths to discover the origins of punctuation, from the mundane to the obscure. A fascinating and surprisingly humourous read, perfect for the type enthusiast who has ever wondered about why marks are named the way they are, used or abused, or missing from our keyboards. [Pick it up on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393064425/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393064425&linkCode=as2&tag=raggwrit-20), if only to admire Hoefler Text in excellently printed form.
