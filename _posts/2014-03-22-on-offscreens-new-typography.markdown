Kai Brach:

> There was certainly nothing ‘wrong’ with my original choice of Calluna as a text family and Cyclone (later Tungsten) for headlines. Hopefully my contemplations below will explain some of the decisions that went into making the change.

An excellent deep-dive into the typographic updates to the beautifully designed Offscreen Magazine. I loved the magazine’s first type choices, but this recent update feels even more refined and unified. A welcome change.

Also, if you don’t already have an issue (or three) of Offscreen, you should definitely [get your hands on it now](http://www.offscreenmag.com/issues/).
