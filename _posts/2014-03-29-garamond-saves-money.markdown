Madeleine Stix, for CNN:

> Using the General Services Administration's estimated annual cost of ink—$467 million—Suvir concluded that if the federal government used Garamond exclusively it could save nearly 30% – or $136 million per year. An additional $234 million could be saved annually if state governments also jumped on board, he reported.

14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani reckons there’s money to be saved by switching government papers to Garamond. Smart kid, but systematic and habitual change is difficult in even the smallest teams, let alone nationwide.

Another thing worth noting is the lack of mention of licensing in the research. Times New Roman can be found on every modern computer for the last couple of decades (with the exception of stock Android operating systems). Garamond doesn’t have quite the same ubiquity, and licensing every government computer would be a costly endeavor.

Pessimism aside, this is impressive research by any measure, and may trigger not only nationwide change, but world-wide awareness of the economic advantages of typographic reviews.
