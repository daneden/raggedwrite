Eric Gill’s <span class="caps">Essay on Typography</span> has been hovering around my Amazon wishlist for some time. Often recommended to me by friends and previously read books alike, my reservations were mainly centered around Gill’s controversial [personal life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill#Personal_life).

Nevertheless, I finally picked up a copy and started reading. Predictably, it is a wonderful essay, beautifully set, and written with charm, authority, and a generous dollop of (often dry) humor. It was, however, not *quite* what I was expecting.

The majority of <span class="caps">Essay</span> is more of a social commentary from Gill on the values of craftsmen in the industrial era than anything else. Contrary to my expectations of a gratuitous romanticism of type design and its many forms, the pages laid bare an almost complete resentment of automated, industrial age printing.

Thankfully, this wasn’t all. Gill proceeds to talk about the origins of lowercase letterforms—their derivation from the capital forms, and the evolution between the two—as well as printing techniques, and practical, actionable advice around typesetting.

In hindsight, as I approached the end of the book, I realised the social commentary was completely, unequivocally necessary so as to set a tone and frame a way of seeing that is required by those intently interested by typography.

Beyond the content of the essay, the copy I managed to get was beautifully set. Cast in Gill’s [Joanna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_(typeface))—a gorgeous transitional serif face with upright italics[^ess1]—and, surprisingly, justified ragged-right, the book was excellently proportioned and a great pleasure to hold, as one would expect from Gill and, today’s publisher of the essay, Penguin.
