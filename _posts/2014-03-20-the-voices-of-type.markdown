Eben Sorkin, for Typecast:

> When thinking about a typeface’s voice, its categorization/classification is not important. Instead, we need to know if the type is cheerful or dour. Is it relaxed or in a hurry? Is the type serious or frivolous? Luxurious or downmarket? Young or old? Fragile or robust?

The Typecast blog is full of accessible typography posts[^blah], and Eben’s is a nice reminder that sometimes *feeling* a typeface instead of analysing it is the right thing to do.

[^blah]: I’ve written a few posts for them myself: [“Tailor-Made Type for Web Design”](http://typecast.com/blog/tailor-made-type-for-web-design), [“Ten Display Faces for Under $50”](http://typecast.com/blog/type-on-screen-10-display-faces-for-under-50), [“Five Faces for UI Design”](http://typecast.com/blog/type-on-screen-5-faces-for-ui-design), and [“Superhero Superfamilies”](http://typecast.com/blog/type-on-screen-superhero-superfamilies)
