Over the last few years, I’ve come to realise that the typographic world interests me to worrying levels.

I choose restaurants based on the typography of their menus. I scrutinise people who set their résumés to run the full length of an A4 sheet in 10pt type. And I’m unable to open a collaborative Google Doc without changing the fonts from the default Arial and Tahoma car crash.

On my eternal journey to typographic snobbery, I’ve also realised that there’s always something to learn about typography. We know that 50–70 characters per line is optimal, but why? And how does it change between typefaces, if at all? What about in creative settings, such as poetry?

The answer to a lot of these questions is “it depends.” But that’s not to say that people aren’t coming up with some interesting ideas in the process.

That’s what Ragged Write is for. It’s a selfish endeavour; a place for me to curate the answers to these questions from experts in the field, record events and advancements in the technology and practice of typography, and share personal commentary.

With any luck, some of you out there may find it useful. If not, the project is only a failure if it fails to satisfy my own need. And I’m quite easily pleased.

Happy typesetting.
