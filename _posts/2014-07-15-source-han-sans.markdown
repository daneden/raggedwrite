Caleb Belohlavek, on the [Typekit blog](http://blog.typekit.com/2014/07/15/introducing-source-han-sans/):

> Never before has a typeface family of this magnitude, development scope, and value been offered via open source — which makes it a no-cost solution for designers, developers, and everyday users who need a font supporting a broad set of languages. Adobe is changing the world through digital experiences, and the release of Source Han Sans is yet another way we can forward that vision by giving to the community.

I’ve been spending a lot of time looking at non-Latin typefaces, and Source Han Sans is a welcome addition to a small selection. The entire Source family is a wonderful accomplishment from Adobe & Google, and I’m looking forward to seeing even more developments over the years.
