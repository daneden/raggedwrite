Erik Spiekermann:

> As a typeface designer who cares deeply about the industry in which I work, I have watched Monotype not merely survive, but grow and prosper. They have become respected experts in the business and the technology of type. Having my typefaces become part of the Monotype foundry will make sure that they, as well as the other FontFonts, will benefit from Monotype’s strengths. The industry-at-large will be stronger once FontShop adds its creative prowess to Monotype’s business.

This came as a shock to me. Not an unwelcome one, mind. Monotype seems to have been loosening up, and they’ve done an excellent job with their other [acquisitions](http://typecast.com). I’m excited to see them give a leg up to FontShop.
