Ferdinand Ulrich, for FontShop[^1]:

> The short intervals of designs released in the late 1920s and early 1930s suggest that there were instead many “types of their time”. The following introduces some of these original designs of the geometric concept in the metal type era, their earliest revivals in the 1970s as well as new interpretations in the years to follow and contemporary developments of this popular genre in type design.

Described as a “short history of the geometric sans”, this post is actually quite a comprehensive essay on the origins and founding families of geometric sans type.

Well worth taking the time to read.

[^1]: It’s also worth taking note of FontShop’s recent new design-in-progress. Read more about the new look [here](http://next.fontshop.com/content/simple-but-radical).
