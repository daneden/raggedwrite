> Surveyor® is a new family of fonts inspired by the traditional mapmaker’s letter. It revives a style of lettering that’s unique to cartography, one that evolved in the early nineteenth century and endured for as long as maps were printed by engraving.

And a beautiful thing it is, too. [Surveyor](http://www.typography.com/fonts/surveyor/overview/) comes in five weights (and three optical sizes each), each with italics and small caps, as well as five swash weights and five numeric weights.

Beyond the details, Surveyor is extremely beautifully designed and ready for a diverse range of applications. And, of course, a ScreenSmart edition is available for use on web & screen.

A marvelous addition to Hoefler & Co.’s substantial catalogue. I expect it pairs beautifully with [Mercury](http://www.typography.com/fonts/mercury-text/overview/).
