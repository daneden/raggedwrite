H&Co. today announced a new addition to their catalogue, [Tungsten Rounded](http://www.typography.com/fonts/tungsten-rounded/overview/):

> The rounded sans serif is a typographic chameleon. It can look relaxed and natural, as if its soft edges have been weathered by erosion; it can be cool and detached, machined with the accuracy of a precision part, or stamped with the indifference of a license plate. Its weight can affect its tone dramatically, changing the mood from the no-frills immediacy of a rubber stamp to the fleshy abundance of an over-inked printing plate.

Marketing spiel aside, it certainly looks ready for a diverse range of applications. It also lends itself very well to a sort of [90s design aesthetic](https://www.google.com/search?q=90s+design&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=eOLFU9umGoatyASq4oKACA&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1304&bih=681). Take that as you will.
