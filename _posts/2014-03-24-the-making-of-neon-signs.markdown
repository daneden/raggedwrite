A beautiful short film looking at the dangerous, aging, and incredible art of neon sign lettering and manufacture in Hong Kong.

Non-latin characters are often overlooked, but I’ve recently become very smitten indeed by the Asian alphabets. This little film does a good job of documenting not only the complexity of the process of neon sign making, but also the beauty of the characters being set. Until I’m challenged with international typesetting, I can get my fix from places like [Muji](http://www.muji.us/).

Also [featured](http://www.typography.com/blog/the-making-of-neon-signs) on the Hoefler & Co blog, where you’ll find a more verbose description of the video.
