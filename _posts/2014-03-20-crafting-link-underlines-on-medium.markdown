Marcin Wichary:

> Unfortunately, for all the advances in web typography we’ve seen during the years — better CSS properties, more support for internationalization, custom web fonts — underlines remained mostly as they were, with very little customization available to web designers.

Medium’s attention to detail seems to resonate down to even the underlines of their links. I noticed Chrome’s butchering of underlines some time ago, but never thought to go about improving it. Good to see Marcin is fighting the good fight.
