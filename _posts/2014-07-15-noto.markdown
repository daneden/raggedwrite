Google’s [Noto](http://www.google.com/get/noto/#/) project is an ambitious one; design a family of typefaces that supports all the worlds languages, with a consistent visual appearance throughout.

It’s also a somewhat flawed goal, if the research I’ve done is anything to go by. Showing [Neue Helvetica Arabic](http://www.linotype.com/670004/neue-helvetica-arabic-family.html) to native speakers of Arabic resulted in quite a surprising response: feedback suggested that the sans-serif typeface appeared juvenile, much like Comic Sans does to Westerners.

That said, the notion of a type family with such wide language support and a consistent visual appearance is a relieving one.
